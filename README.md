### Repo description: 
This repository includes code and documentation for all steps of analysis, from fMRI preprocessing to final reported analyses and figure generation. 
Anonymized subject-level data derived from pre-processed fMRI data is also provided for both tasks to replicate all reported analyses and figures from the manuscript. 
For step-by-step analyses as they appear in the manuscript, see **[full_manuscript_analyses.md]()** which includes embedded links to additional markdown files and Jupyter/R notebooks,
and example calls to functions for high-performance computing environments (see [bin]() for code). 
Markdown files also include extended analysis description and logic, but see **[main manuscript]()** for conceptual descriptions and justification of all hypotheses and analyses.
