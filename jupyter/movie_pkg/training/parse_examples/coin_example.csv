okay so it starts off with a rocket ship coming into view
It continues to fly across the screen
and then transitions to a boy holding the rocket ship
he's holding his other hand
he's walking
eventually he lets go
and he needs to run around with the rocket ship
playing with it
moving it around
and then he stops 
and sees something off screen
and it pans to uh like a machine
like a toy riding machine that's shaped just like the rocket ship
so he approaches excitedly 
and he tries to um
"I think the words coin operated"" shows up on the screen"""
and then he tries to get his mother to let him on
and get the coin from his pocket
he gets on 
and his mother signals him off again
and then he presses the button
and the machine stops 
and he realizes 
he doesn't have any more coins to run the machine
but then he looks at the lemon sign 
and has the idea to build a lemonade stand
so he builds the stand
and starts selling lemonade
and then eventually shows a time lapse of him getting older
selling lemonade
collecting coins
eventually he's like an old man
he has like a large bag of coins
and eventually he closes down the lemonade stand
he takes the bag of coins with him in like a little wagon
and then he trudges towards the machine he rode before
he pours all the coins into the machine
and then gets on like the hopeful expression
presses the button
but then realizes it's not working
and he looks really sad
he lightly hit the machine and eventually starts shaking
and he gets really excited
and he kind of like blasts off
and then it transitions to him looking like a child again in the sky
